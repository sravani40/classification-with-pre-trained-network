# classification-with-pre-trained-network

classification of STL10 dataset with pretrained resnet 
5 different batch sizes and 2 different learning rates are used to see the variation in classification accuracy.
high batch size with low learning rate did not perform better
with high batch size either we have to use high learning rate or more number of epochs to get same accuracy
